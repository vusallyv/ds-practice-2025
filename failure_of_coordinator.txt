## Analysis of Coordinator Failure in Two-Phase Commit Protocol

In the current implementation, the `OrderExecutorService` acts as the coordinator in the two-phase commit protocol. If this coordinator fails during the protocol execution, several issues can arise:

### Failure Scenarios and Consequences:

1. **Failure after PREPARE phase, before sending COMMIT/ABORT decisions**:
    - Participants remain in a prepared state, holding resources locked
    - The transaction is left in an indeterminate state
    - Resources remain locked indefinitely, causing system availability issues

2. **Failure during COMMIT phase, after sending some commits**:
    - Partial commit scenario - some participants commit, others don't
    - System left in an inconsistent state
    - Data integrity compromised

3. **Failure before recording decision**:
    - When coordinator recovers, it won't know what decision was made
    - Cannot reliably complete the transaction

### Solution: Coordinator Recovery Protocol

1. **Persistent Transaction Log**:
    - Coordinator should maintain durable logs of transaction states
    - Log updates must occur before sending messages to participants

2. **Recovery Coordinator**:
    - Implement a backup coordinator with access to the transaction logs
    - Use leader election to select a new coordinator if primary fails

3. **Termination Protocol**:
    - Allow participants to communicate with each other if coordinator fails
    - Participants can collectively determine transaction outcome

4. **Timeouts and Inquiries**:
    - Participants should timeout and query other participants about transaction status
    - Implement a "cooperative termination protocol" among participants

This approach ensures that transactions can complete even when the coordinator fails, maintaining system consistency and availability.
